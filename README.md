## Supporting files
Each folder (part-x) contains files stored in the following structure:
* *demo-files* folder contains the sample configuration files
* *docker-images* folder and its sub-folders contain the files necessary to produce the referred container images. You may use your own images, but keep in mind that you should adjust the configuration files as well
* *exercise-files* folder contains a set of configuration files suitable for a guided exercise
* *demo-script.txt* file contains the commands used during the demo
* *slides.pdf* file contains the slides of the presentation
* *video.txt* file contains the URL of the published video of the event

For better experience load the *demo-script.txt* file in an editor with an integrated terminal (like Visual Studio Code, Kate, Atom, Sublime, etc.), highlight and execute commands one by one, and check the results.
