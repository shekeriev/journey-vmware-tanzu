# VMUG Bulgaria - The Journey To VMware Tanzu - Part 1 - Minikube
# Online, Dimitar Zahariev, 2021.07.06
# 

# 
# For the purpose of this demo we will assume that:
# - We are working on a Windows 10 machine
# - There is a recent version of VMware Workstation (16.x) installed
# - We have access to a Docker instance (either in a locally installed, VM-based, or elsewhere)
# 

# 
# Warm up with containers in Docker
# - test the process-container relation
# - background services (or detached continuosly running containers)
# - port redirection
# - data exchange with the host
# - layered filesystem
#

# Let's start a simple Alpine-based container
docker container run --name alp1 -it alpine sh

# Explore a bit and then execute the exit command
exit

# Now check if there are any containers running with
docker container ls

# None. Let's change the command to
docker container ls -a

# Aha, here is our container. Let's remove it 
docker container rm alp1

# And start a new one but this time with (execute it outside an editor)
docker container run --name alp1 -it --rm alpine sh

# Explore a bit. Once done, hit Ctrl+P Ctrl+Q to close the session

# Now check if there are any containers running with
docker container ls

# It is there and running

# To return back, execute 
docker container attach alp1

# Now, let's close the session and exit the container
exit

# Let's start a container out of the official NGINX image
docker container run --name web1 -d nginx

# Check what containers are running
docker container ls

# Try to access the web page in the running container
curl http://localhost

# No success

# Let's stop and remove the container
docker container rm --force web1

# Now, start a new one but with port redirection (you may need to adjust the rule - host-port:container-port)
docker run --name web1 -d -p 80:80 nginx

# Try to access the web page in the running container
curl http://localhost

# This time it is working as expected

# Let's stop and remove the container
docker container rm --force web1

# What if we want to use a custom web page?
# First option is to mount or specify one during the container creation process

# Let's create a folder with a custom index.html file in it
mkdir web
echo 'My cutom page :)' > web/index.html

# Now, run a container with it
docker run --name web1 -d -p 80:80 -v $(pwd)/web:/usr/share/nginx/html:ro nginx

# Try to access the web page in the running container
curl http://localhost

# Again, it is working as expected

# Let's stop and remove the container
docker container rm --force web1

# Now, let's create our own image and thest the layered filesystem

# Create a Dockerfile file in it with the following content
FROM nginx
COPY web/index.html /usr/share/nginx/html

# Create the image with
docker image build -t my-nginx:v1 .

# List the images
docker image ls

# Now, run a container based on our image
docker run --name web1 -d -p 80:80 my-nginx:v1

# Try to access the web page in the running container
curl http://localhost

# We should see the new (the one made by us) default index page

# Open a session to the container 
docker container exec -it web1 bash

# And change the /usr/share/nginx/html/index.html file
echo 'Another page :)' > /usr/share/nginx/html/index.html

# Close the session
exit

# Try to access the web page in the running container
curl http://localhost

# Check the changes that happened to the container's filesystem
docker container diff web1

# Let's stop and remove the container
docker container rm --force web1

# We warmed up and are ready to move forward ;)

# Exercise (Pod + Service)
# 
# Supporting files in the exercise-files folder
# 
###############################
# Task:
#  Pick up a web server image from a public registry, adjust the two manifest files, and deploy them to Kubernetes
###############################
# Plan:
#  1. Explore the two files 1-appx-pod.yml and 1-appx-svc.yml
#  2. Navigate to Docker Hub (https://hub.docker.com) and search for nginx or apache
#  3. Pick up one and explore its details
#  4. Replace the <<image:tag>> text in the 1-appx-pod.yml file with the selected image name and tag
#  5. Replace the <<container-port>> text in the 1-appx-pod.yml file with the port on which the container provides its service (if not explicitly mentioned, use port 80)
#  6. Use the same value from step #5 for the <<service-port>> and <<pod-port>> text in the 1-appx-svc.yml file
#  7. Pick up a number in the range 30000-32767 and replace the <<external-port>> text in the 1-appx-svc.yml file with it
#  8. Don't forget to align label values on both the pod and service
#  9. Save the changes to both files
# 10. Send both files to the cluster
# 11. Check what resources have been created
# 12. Examine each resource
# 13. Check if the application is working
# 14. Clean up by deleting both the pod and service
